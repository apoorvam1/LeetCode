#### What is a prioriry queue?
It's an abstract datatype similar to queue but the elements have certain priority. Priority queue can only have elements that are comparable i.e elements
should be able to be ordered from lowest to highest or highest to lowest.

The elements with the highest priority will be removed first. 

Priority queue internally uses heap to manage the priority. A heap can be a Max Heap or a Min Heap. A binary heap is a heap with at most 2 children. There can 
be a binomial heaps as well.
