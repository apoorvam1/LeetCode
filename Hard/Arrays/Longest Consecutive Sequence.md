Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

```
Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Solution**

```
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        int len = 0;
        Set<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
        
        for(int n: nums) {
            hs.add(n);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int localLen = 1;
            //if previous number is present either it's sequence is already explored
            // or we will explore it when we encounter it
            // This makes sure that we don't find the sequence for same number many times
            int cur = nums[i];
            if(hs.contains(cur-1)) continue;
            // loop over if cur is the beginning of the sequence
            while(hs.contains(cur+1)) {
                localLen++;
                cur++;
            }
            len = Math.max(len, localLen);
        }   
        return len;
    }
}
```

Time complexity : O(n).

Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be linear. Because the while loop is reached only when cur marks the beginning of a sequence (i.e. cur-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for n iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.
