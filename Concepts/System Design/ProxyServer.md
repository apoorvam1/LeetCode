### Proxy Server
A proxy server is a `server application` that acts on behalf of the client when requesting a service and potentially masking the true origin of the request from the server.


Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a requested resource, such as a file or web page for example, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This could benifit in providing load balancing, sercirity and privacy.
