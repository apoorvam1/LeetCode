1.  Extract part of the array
    - Arrays.copyOfRange(res, startIndex(inclusive), endIndex(inclusive));
    
2.  When working with arrays containing negative numbers check if Math.abs(val) helps simplify the problem

3. Reverse an array
    - Collections.reverse(Arrays.asList(arr));

4. Print an array
    - Arrays.toString(arr);
    
5. Array of unknown size can't be initialized. List is the best solution for such cases.

6. Array manipulation problems need not involve in-place changes, we can put the result in a new array. 

7. Think of using 2 indexes one from the beginning one from the end.

8. Try if HashTables/HashMap can be used.

9. If array elements have some pattern then summation,xor or using hashmap might help.

10. Using character as an index to an integer array (array[char]) gives the ascii index of that array. 

11. str.chatAt(i) 
	- if stored in int var, gives the string's ith character's ascii value.
	- if stored in char var, gives the string's ith character value.
    
12. Check if sorting helps	

13. If a sorted array is rotated, 
	- finding pivot point might help find the solution
	- Either low to pivot or pivot+1 to high will always be sorted
    
14. To initialize var to max values, Say for integer 
	- int a = Integer.MAX_VALUE
