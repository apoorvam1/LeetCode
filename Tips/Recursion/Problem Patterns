1. A Child is running up a staircase with 'n' steps and it can hop either 1 step, 2 step or 3 steps at a time. 
Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

Finding Recursive solution: 
How many ways are there to reach the 'N'th step? from n-1th step, n-2th step or n-3rd step.  

***************************
1. If the question is about the result at the end(nth) stage, think about how any 'N'th stage can be reached?
2. It's ok if the recursion call passes negative value in some case, base case should handle it
3. When the result or recursion increases in each call, think about overflow.
4. When recursion is returning boolean, check if the base case and default return value should be true or false.
