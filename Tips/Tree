Ancestor Problem

If the problem involves keeping track of ancestors create a child-parent map of each node and use it further

How to Memoize the calculated hieght of a node in tree?
That would be by calculating the height from the leaf and pass it to the parent and reach to the root.
Hence the first thing to do the call would be to recusively call method on left and right node
Ex: getHt(Node n) 
      n == null ret 0;
      h1 = getHt(n.left)
      h2 = getHt(n.right)
      ....
      

If any problem involves depth/height of a tree consider below facts
- The curDepth at the root is 1
- Depth is reached when a leaf node is found
