Given a linked list reverse print it. 

W's: How large the data set will be? Recursion can take a lot of space. 
    Why data will it hold?
    Is there any specific format expected while printing output?
    
public class Node {
  int value;
  Node next;
}

public void reversePrint(Node head) {
  if(head == null) return;
  reversePrint(head.next);
  System.out.println(head.value);
}

Same as post order traversal.
