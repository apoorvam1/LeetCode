Prep Guide

A Redditor who secured a job at FAANG reveals the ultimate hacks for acing interviews at any company:

Step 1: Skipping the Black Hole
* ﻿﻿I never applied through company portals. They get thousands of applications, and ATS filters out most of them.
* ﻿﻿Instead, I targeted engineers and hiring managers on Linkedin and asked for referrals.
* ﻿﻿I kept my messages short and to the point: "Hey [Name], I'm really interested in [Team/Company] and l'd love to apply. I have [X years] of experience in [Relevant Skill], and I think l'd be a great fit. Would you be open to referring me?"
* ﻿﻿This got me multiple referrals in a week, and I went straight to recruiter screens instead of waiting in the void.

Step 2: Only Studying What Actually Gets Asked
* ﻿﻿Instead of grinding hundreds of LeetCode problems, I reverse-engineered the interview questions:
* ﻿﻿I searched Glassdoor, Blind, and LeetCode discussion forums for recent questions from my target company.
* ﻿﻿I found patterns-most companies ask the same 10-15 core problems repeatedly.
* ﻿﻿Instead of solving 500 random problems, I studied:
* ﻿﻿Top 30 questions per company (sorted by frequency)
* ﻿﻿Patterns, not solutions (e.g., "Oh, this is just a sliding window problem with a twist.")
* ﻿﻿Mock interviews on Pramp and with friends to get real-time feedback.
* ﻿﻿Result? I was solving interview questions in under 10 minutes instead of struggling through brute-force solutions.

Step 3: Finessing the Behavioral Interview
* ﻿﻿FAANG behavioral rounds aren't about "personality" —they're looking for structured answers
* ﻿﻿I prepped 5 stories using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and adapted them on the fly.
* ﻿﻿The key? Always show impact with metrics. Instead of saying: "I helped optimize a backend service," " I said: "I optimized the backend service, reducing latency by 40% and saving $500K in cloud costs."
* ﻿﻿Biggest trick? If they ask about failure, always spin it into a win ("I learned X, and it led to Y success later").

Step 4: Exploiting the Hiring Process Loopholes
* ﻿﻿I timed my interviews strategically-companies move faster when they know you have other offers.
* ﻿﻿I sought out hiring events and "bar-raiser" systems (Amazon, for example, has bar-raisers who can override bad interviewers).
* ﻿﻿I built relationships with my recruiter-they have power to push through borderline candidates and help with negotiations.

Step 5: Offer and Negotiation Hacks
* ﻿﻿Once I had one offer, I used it to pressure other companies to move faster.
* ﻿﻿I acted slightly disinterested-companies chase candidates who seem in demand.
* ﻿﻿I negotiated hard:
* ﻿﻿"I love the opportunity, but my other offer is at $X-can you match or improve it?"
* ﻿﻿"| was hoping for a higher base/signing bonus to align with market rates."
* ﻿﻿Result? +$40K increase in total compensation.
